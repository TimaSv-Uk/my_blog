# GET IT DONE **01.02.2026**
#### at least initial version, maybe i'll make if inspiration and time will strike
## MY PLLLAN:
    - render json as a shelf of books
        - variables for rendered books: 
            page_count => width, height
            color => take primary color from cover(find in browser automaticly)
            spesial_effects for favorite_books(if [docs][i][doc_favorites_time] > 0)

            custom_spesial_effects for personal_favorite_books,
                and dont fucking dear to forget to write proper revievs
