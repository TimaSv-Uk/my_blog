# Just come up with a courage to comment on old KOReader issue 

[KOReader neither opening books from PocketBook default file browser nor appearing in the "Open With" dialogue #3544](https://github.com/koreader/koreader/issues/3544)

It toke me couple of hours to figure this out so i home someone may find my comment useful 
And i'd really like to contribute to KOReader codebase in any way 

## I enjoy using KOReader the only problems i can find:
- no real page number only electronic (real page 1500/1800 words per page) i would like there be such option by default (i added patch that allow that allows use [Reference page number])
- make it faster on first launch; But that is not realistic it probably opens slow because of my old potato EReade PocketBook Touch Lux 4

## I probably need to look for some PocketBooks related issues and try to reproduce them 


My comment by the way
```
PocketBook Touch Lux 4

At first KOReader did not apear as an option "Open with" on my PocketBook.

How how i made KOReader open books by default: on launch of reader, from main menu, and apear in "Open with" after long press on book.

Open KOReader on your device ->
Open top menu ->
Click "gear" looking icon ->
Tap "Devises" option ->
Tap "Associate file extentions" ->
Chose formats you want koreader to open and check the boxes ->
Return to pocketbook main screan and KOReader will apear in "Open with" after long press on book (given that books in previosly selected format)
