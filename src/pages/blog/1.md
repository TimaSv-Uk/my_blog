So, this is the first entry;


Today i just passed Python exam in my university. That sure has'nt been any fun.
Our dear lazy ass Teacher just smashed last test assignment added one theothycal  
question, one of previous lab about Jupiter notebook and an awful conclusion
i thought it was a piece of cake but sure got my ass sweaty and almost submited it late,
in the end i got a decent grade.

After all i think  the course was pretty good, made me more familiar with **Docker**,
Python part was pretty boring, thou now i think about what we've been through **10 labs in all**:
I have used AI to code large parte off most of my labs, not because of 
difficulty but tediosness and lack of time

- docker basics, and some docker-compose
- LATEX markdown syntax
- i learn that i like Laravel more than DJango
- how to call an API, already knew that
- some python syntax, already knew that

In all one of less anoing and solid courses with balanced difficulty and enough useful stuff to learn. 


On my own i learned about **UV** and i love it
