Main idea or Message of `Player piano` by Kurt Vonnegut
Interpreted by Suzanne McConnell 
Pity the reader; chapter 3

`
When machines increacingly do our work the incalculable
cost or loss in terms of people cense of being needed and useful,
the foundation of self respect.
`

Message of the book ,opinion on book, possibly Kurt's own words. I don't realy care.
That sentence sums up all of ChatGPT and IA
shenanigans and software developers anxiety around it.

In terms of factory's and mechanical laborers who were
replaced by machines things not look so bright for dev's.
But i don't think that is the case, and don't really care to elaborate why.
(in short develiping softwate is more akin to art than manual labour)

For me that quote points at the cause of defeatism among dev's. 
And don't worry IA wont take all of yout **self respect**, if you won't let it.
